### Why ML

"We know a lot about what bacteria do in a petri dish, but very little about what they do in dirt,"
my microbiology advisor said to me one afternoon. Transferring to Education for graduate school, I discovered that the same problems apply to social sciences and usability as well.

Machine Learning builds on methods for looking at complexity in data. Very few things in the world we live in can be described in terms of pre-defined categories. Increasingly we find that the need to _understand_ requires looking at intersectional relationships, networks, and fuzzy nearest-neighbor clouds. ML offers ways to tease out relevant factors from complex data sets, in ways that can complement qualitative methods such as biography, ethnography, and grounded theory.

For my graduate work, I researched how we can use natural language processing to identify and foster healthier communities. As an Instructional Designer, a big challenge was to create systems that adapt to the needs of _individual_ learners and their mentors.
