# Summary

I'm a Software Engineering Student at Ada Developers Academy starting a second
career in software engineering including Python, Flask, Javascript, React, and
HTML. My previous experience includes 12 years of eLearning development in
higher education, managing home Linux servers, data analysis using Python, and
organizing support services for the local LGBTQ community.

I hope to start a new career where I can combine my passion for computer
programming with my focus on improving the lives of software users.
