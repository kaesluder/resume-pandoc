# Summary

I'm a Software Engineering Student at Ada Developers Academy starting 
a second career in software engineering. My current areas of focus are 
Python, Flask, Javascript, React, and HTML. My previous experience includes 
12 years of eLearning development in higher education, managing home Linux
